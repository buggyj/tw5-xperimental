TW5-jstinker
=============

This plugin can be extended by adding to the templates. An example is `$:/js/templates/exporters/StaticRiver/Content/js` which adds to the basic hmtl template. Note the use of the tag `$:/tag/jstinker/body`. There is also the need to feed the template's filter,  eg `exportFilterjs` in this example. This is done by adding a filter eg see `ExportFilterJs` note the tag of `$:/tags/jstinker`.
