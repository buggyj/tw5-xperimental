title: Parsing inner tree
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

we could use the htmp+ 'inner' to build a javascript object - eg using set
`<$mustache.....>
<$set name = x value = y>
<$/mustache>`

this would include the name x like so
{'x':'y'}

!!problems

there would  be no refresh, so every refresh we would have to re-create the  input from the inner tree and compare with the last created values.
