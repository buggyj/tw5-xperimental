  <h1>Ractive test</h1>

  <!--
       1. This is the element we'll render our Ractive to. 
  -->
  <div id="container"></div>

  <!--
       2. You can load a template in many ways. For convenience, we'll include it in
       a script tag so that we don't need to mess around with AJAX or multiline strings.
       Note that we've set the type attribute to 'text/ractive' - though it can be
       just about anything except 'text/javascript'
  -->
 
<$script id='template' type='text/ractive' source="template1"/>


  <!--
       3. You can always get the most recent stable version from the URL below.
       If you want the newest features (unstable!), use the 'edge' version instead:

           http://cdn.ractivejs.org/edge/ractive.min.js

       If you need IE8 support, change 'ractive' to 'ractive-legacy'.

  <!--
       4. We've got an element in the DOM, we've created a template, and we've
       loaded the library - now it's time to build our Hello World app.
  -->

<$script type="text/javascript" source="code1">
