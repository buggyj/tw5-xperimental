<p>With a transclusion using partials, is the dom torn down? It is possible to have a 'tabs' type widget that that takes a list of bitols and produces a switchable list of views. Basically there would be a slider type widget hiding a transclusion widget. There would need to be a list of bitols supplied as a list to the tabs widget.</p>
