TW5-marked
==============
this was an atempt to create the output as a tw5 ast instread of html. 
- it fails with the html tags - it appears that the author takes a short cut as when you output html input html does not need to be process and is passed thru as is.

1. To build the pluging (in to a test tiddlywiki) clone to a localdir
2. set the environmental variable TW5_ROOT to the location of your nodejs tiddlywiki.js (i.e. your tiddlywiki5 rootdir)
3. cd to ` localdir/xplugins/bj/mdplus/build/demo/output/`
4. run the command `bld.sh`
5. mdplus.html is in `localdir/xplugins/bj/mdplus/build/demo/output`
